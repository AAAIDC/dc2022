1. The application asks me to provide names of 5 AI researchers as possible mentors. Is there a list?
    - No, there isn't a list. AAAI attendance varies every year and we don't know who will attend AAAI in advance. This year will be different due to the remote nature of the conference. You can look the the 2020 program committee members on the [about](https://aaaidc.github.io/dc2022/about/) page and find scientists whose research excites you. Otherwise, provide the names of 5 researchers that you know about and we will do our best to find someone who has similar research interests.
    
    
2. Do I need to use the AAAI template for the DC abstract?
    - Yes, please use the official templates. Not using the official template will result in a desk rejection.
