**Abstract**: In this talk I discuss the opportunities open by doing multi-disciplinary work in AI and possible impacts, positive and negative, in the career of the researchers involved. I will discuss those issues based on some of the multi-disciplinary projects I have been involved with during my career, including cases of artistic work, collaboration with museums and theme parks, corporate events, and university engagements. I will also provide some advice on how to manage multi-disciplinary teams.
