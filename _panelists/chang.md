bio: Maria Chang is a research scientist at IBM Research AI. She specializes in knowledge representation and reasoning, and how different types of symbolic and neuro-symbolic representations can be used for natural language understanding, analogical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and temporal reasoning. She has applied this work to a variety of tasks, including complex question answering, natural language inference, event-based information extraction, and schema induction. She also has a background in AI in education and has worked on educational software solutions that use sketch understanding and mixed initiative dialogue. Her work appears in AI and cognitive science conferences and journals, such as AI magazine, AAAI, IAAI, Topics in Cognitive Science, Spatial Cognition, and Neuroimage. She received a PhD in computer science from Northwestern University (2016) and a BA in cognitive science from UC Berkeley.
