bio: Matthew E. Taylor (Matt) received his doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin in the summer of 2008, supervised by Peter Stone. He then completed a two-year postdoctoral research position at the University of Southern California with Milind Tambe and spent 2.5 years as an assistant professor at Lafayette College. He was then an assistant professor at Washington State University where he held the Allred Distinguished Professorship in Artificial Intelligence. In 2017, he temporarily left academia to help start an artificial intelligence lab in Edmonton, Alberta, with Borealis AI, the artificial intelligence research lab for the Royal Bank of Canada, where, among other things, he contributed to a deployed reinforcement learning agent for stock trading. He is now a tenured associate professor in computer science at the University of Alberta, a Fellow-in-Residence at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute, and remains an adjunct professor at Washington State University. He has been a PI or co-PI on over $7M USD in competitively awarded research funding from federal, state, and industrial sources, including a National Science Foundation CAREER award and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair. He has (co-)supervised 7 graduated PhD students and 5 MS students in the Intelligent Robot Learning Lab, as well as published over 120 peer-reviewed papers in conferences and journals. His current fundamental and applied research interests are in reinforcement learning, human-in-the-loop AI, multi-agent systems, and robotics.
