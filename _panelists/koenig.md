bio: Sven Koenig is a professor of computer science at the University of Southern California and was also a program director at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Most of his research centers around techniques for decision making (planning and learning) that enable single situated agents (such as robots or decision-support systems) and teams of agents to act intelligently in their environments and exhibit goal-directed behavior in real-time, even if they have only incomplete knowledge of their environment, imperfect abilities to manipulate it, limited or noisy perception or insufficient reasoning speed. Sven is proud of his students, who have won many awards.
